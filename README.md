 - Annual Analysis: If you set the period to 365, you are essentially looking at yearly patterns in your data. You would be analyzing or modeling the data with a focus on identifying trends, seasonality, or other recurring patterns that occur on an annual basis. This can be useful for long-term investment or financial planning.

 - Long-Term Forecasting: If you are interested in long-term forecasting, setting a period of 365 means you are making predictions based on the assumption that historical data repeats itself in annual cycles.
